                  "My name is Nikilitha Kakaza,born on the 26th of June 2003. I was born and raised in Cape Town in a township called Khayelitsha. I chose web development because I think having an online presence is essential to any business's success. Although I am aware of the opportunities, I would prefer to concentrate on coding and designing stunning websites rather than freelancing. I like to cook and doing make-up(content creation) on my spare time. I graduted in 2024, I graduated in Psychology at the Nelson Mandela University. I did this course becaus I was not sure of what I really wanted at first, but now I finally dicided to do coding which I enjoy so much. A true defination of 'follow what your heart desires'. I love exploring and trying out new ideas based on the knowledge I have, so if you think you share the same sentiment as mine, don't be scared to contact me and we shall work magic. ðŸ˜Š"
